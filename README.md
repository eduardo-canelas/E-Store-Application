# E-Store-Application
Java application that creates a standalone GUI application that simulates an e-store. We’ll call our store Nile Dot Com... we’re not quite as big as Amazon.com!1 The application will allow the user to place in stock items into a shopping cart and once all items are included, total all costs (including tax).
