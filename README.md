-   **Shopping Cart**: Support for up to 5 items with add/remove functionality

### 🎨 **User Experience**

-   **Intuitive GUI**: Clean Java Swing interface with responsive design
-   **Real-time Validation**: Instant feedback for stock availability and input errors
-   **Transaction History**: Persistent storage of all completed purchases
-   **Professional Invoicing**: Detailed receipts with timestamps and transaction IDs

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

-   **File-based Database**: CSV inventory management system
-   **Event-driven Architecture**: Comprehensive button state management
-   **Error Handling**: Robust validation for all user inputs
-   **Data Persistence**: Automatic transaction logging with timestamps

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

-   Java 8 or higher installed on your system
-   Terminal/Command Prompt access

### Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eduardo-canelas/E-Store-Application.git
    cd E-Store-Application
    ```

2. **Compile the application**

    ```bash
    javac NileDotCom.java
    ```

3. **Run the application**

3. **Manage Cart**: Use "Delete Last Item" to remove items or "Empty Cart" to clear all
4. **Checkout**: Click "Check Out" to complete your purchase and generate an invoice
5. **View History**: Check `transactions.csv` for purchase history

## 📊 Sample Inventory

The application comes with a diverse inventory of 45+ items including:

-   **Electronics**: USB cables, ink cartridges, desk fans
-   **Office Supplies**: Staplers, screwdrivers, index cards
-   **Accessories**: Helmets, sunglasses, calendars
-   **And much more!**

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Inspired Design**

*This project showcases practical application of Java programming concepts, GUI development, and software engineering principles in an enterprise simulation environment.*E-Store-Application
Java application that creates a standalone GUI application that simulates an e-store. We’ll call our store Nile Dot Com... we’re not quite as big as Amazon.com!1 The application will allow the user to place in stock items into a shopping cart and once all items are included, total all costs (including tax).
